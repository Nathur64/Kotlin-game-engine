    Hello, the MouseI class (aka mouse-input),
     nor GameKeys function will not be available in the public version in source-code form,
     however there is a substitute class which will allow you to work on your own classes without errors poping up.  
    Due to how much people complain about hacked clients,
     and even hacked-client users having a preference for hacked-clients being less possible.  
    I have decided that the 'io' namespace is going to remain private from this point on until further notice.  
    It is possible that I will never release the 'io' namespace to the public.  
    Seeing the struggles that minecraft has due to the 'io' being public,
     at least to the extent were there are hacked clients,
     this game-engine might never have its 'io' namespace revealed,
     and the public may only have access to a compiled version of it.  
    If there are errors, you can be sure to let me know.  
    In the place of your access to the 'io' namespace,
     there are some other classes planned to do basically the same thing,
     however those classes will be limited to the video-game protocol.  
    People in the minecraft community are worrying about the criminal form of hacking being added to hacked clients,
     therefore the 'io' namespace is off limits to the public,
     and they will have to settle for some of the 'd' classes,
     which cannot be used for hacking anything but a specific directory that the client is in,
     or other directories listed in a '.DirAcc' file in the future.  
    Said directory-access files will not be allowed to list their directory or any parrent directories,
     which will keep hackers from gaining access to the rest of the computer system.  
    Have a nice day.  :)
