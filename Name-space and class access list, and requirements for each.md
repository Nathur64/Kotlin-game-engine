I welcome your contribution, and look forward to a point in time when this game-engine becomes widely used by game-developers, and run by gamers and game-server owners.  

Background checks are required to join my team, but you can contribute to parts of this project as you see needed.  



com:
    This is one name-space that is completely open to people who would like to add their own contributions to this project.  

io:
    Write-access to 'io' is restricted to me and my team.  

net:
    This name-space is only for my team and I to add classes that may not have direct relations to a game.  

org:
    This name-space is specifically for a video-game, as this is the goal of this project.  

sec:
    This name-space is writen exclusivly by this project's team, and it is suppose to help secure video-games from piracy, however it will not be available in source-code form.  
    This is for classes that help authenticate clients so that game-developers can further secure their own video-games.  

res:
    This is not a name-space, but this directory may exist for the purpose of supplying examples.  



'com', 'io', 'net', and 'sec' will be more general use, while 'org' and 'res' will not likely be part of the game-engine itself.  The point is that there will be 4 main sections for the game-engine, each having a role of their own.  I am opening this project up so that you (the public) can help me get this project up and running.  Please keep in mind that buggy code will not be added to the game-engine, however once bugs have been delt with, then we will talk about making it the next version.  Happy coding.
